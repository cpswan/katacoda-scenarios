Forking is the process of making a copy of a repo into another account so that
it can be changed. Here we're going to make a fork of the Shortnames repo, which
contains the shortnames of people who've already done this workshop.

Browse to https://github.csc.com/GDO-CTO/Shortnames _(Ctrl-click on the link to
