Welcome to Part 1 of the Infrastructure as Code Boot Camp

###Purpose

The purpose of this scenario is to introduce Git and GitHub with some basic operations and commands. The scenario will run through the Fork and Pull model, which is a powerful part of open source (and innersource development). Forking a repo lets you make a copy that you can modify without having to ask for any permission. Pull requests provide a means to contribute improvements back to the original source (with permission from the owners of the source repo).

###Content

Within GitHub this scenario will firstly cover forking a repo, and adding an SSH key to facilitate a local copy of the fork (within the Katacoda shell environment). Once some content has been added and committed to the local copy it will be pushed to GitHub, and a pull request can be made against the source repo.

Command line Git will be used within the Katacoda shell to clone the forked repo, add a file to it, configure Git with user information, commit the change and push the change back to GitHub.
