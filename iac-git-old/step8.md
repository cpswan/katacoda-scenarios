We've used 5 of [6 essential git commands](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/762709515133485056/photo/1):

![Memorizing Six Git Commands](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CpWvVOoW8AAjYmB.jpg:thumb)

`git clone` to make a local copy from GitHub

`git add` to track changes, like an added file

`git config` for metadata like name and email

`git commit` to commit the changes (with a `-sm` signed message)

`git push` to push local changes back to GitHub

The 6th essential git command is:

`git pull` to get any changes made on GitHub back to the local copy (without
  having to start from scratch with a new clone).

## Also Try

`git log` to show a summary of commit messages

`git status` to see whether there are changes yet to be committed, pushed or
pulled
